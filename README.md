Confined - OpenGL Rendering Engine and Demo
============================================


##Description
This engine was started as a final project for an upper-year graphics course at the University of Waterloo.
I put quite a lot of time into it and learned a lot about writing GLSL shaders.
It demonstrates a number of more advanced graphic techniques - deferred rendering, screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO), dynamic shadows, bump maps, motion blur, and picking with shaders.
The state of the code is currently a bit messy and fragile as I had to rush to get it done in only a few weeks.
