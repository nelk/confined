CS 488: Introduction to Computer Graphics Coursework
====================================================

This repository is for code I wrote for an upper-year graphics course at the University of Waterloo.
Take a look at my final project (handin/A5/confined) - I put quite a lot of time into it and learned a lot about writing GLSL shaders. It demonstrates a number of more advanced graphic techniques - deferred rendering, screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO), dynamic shadows, bump maps, motion blur, and picking with shaders.
The state of the code is currently a bit messy and fragile as I had to rush to get it done in only a few weeks. I plan to extract Confined into a separate repo and continue working on it in the future.
